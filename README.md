# loans default risk analysis
 practicum project
 this is a practicum project as a journey as a data analyst

 Introduction
The idea is to prepare a report for the credit division of a bank. We will find out the effect of a customer's marital status and the number of children he has on the probability of default in repayment of the loan. The bank already has some data regarding the creditworthiness of customers.

The report will be considered when making **credit assessment** for prospective customers. **Credit scoring** is used to evaluate the ability of potential borrowers to repay their loans.


Stages:
1. Identify and fill in missing values
2. Replace the real number data type with integer type
3. Remove duplicate data
4. Categorize data

Purpose:
find out the effect of a customer's marital status and the number of children he has on the probability of default in repaying the loan

The hypothesis tested:
Is there a relationship between having children and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
Is there a relationship between marital status and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
Is there a relationship between the level of income and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
How do different loan objectives affect a person's probability of defaulting on a loan?

**Final Conclusion**

1. the data is checked in general so that an initial picture is visible, each column is checked whether each data is in accordance with the basic logic and its relation to other data
2. Missing data is filled in by paying attention to the columns that affect it and a decision is made to fill in/delete based on logic
3. Duplicate data is handled with respect to non-numeric columns
4. loans to the real estate category are the loan objectives with the lowest percentage of default, then wedding, education, car, the percentages are increasing successively
5. Loans for the car category, namely for buying a car, are the loan objectives with the highest default percentage
